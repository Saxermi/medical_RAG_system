      "        \"content\": \"Infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) was observed as early as 5000 years ago with evidence, which is a primeval enemy of the humanoid race. MTB is the pathogen which is responsible for causing the infectious disease tuberculosis; it remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in poor low-income countries as well as in developing countries because of non-availability of reliable laboratory facilities. The current treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is lengthy, complex, and connected with severe harmful side effects and poor outcomes. The present cure against tuberculosis has substantial restrictions, in terms of their efficiency, side-effect outline, and complication of handling. Furthermore, the emergence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) outbreaks during the 1990s and additionally in recent times the vast deadly strains of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) and totally drug resistance tuberculosis (TDR-TB) is hampering efforts to control and manage tuberculosis (TB). As a result, novel methodologies for the treatment of multi-drug-resistant and extensive drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) are severely desired. A number of new potential anti-tuberculosis drug candidates with novel modes of action have been entered in clinical trials in recent years. These agents are most likely to be effective against resistant strains. The treatment landscape is beginning to shift, with the recent approvals by Food and Drug Administration to the new TB drugs bedaquiline and delamanid. Also, the pipeline of potential new treatments has been fulfilled with several compounds in clinical trials or preclinical development with promising activities against sensitive and resistant MTB bacteria. An additional new chemical entity is also under development. The already existing drugs with their suggested mode of treatment as well as new probable anti-tuberculosis drug moieties which are at present in the pipeline has been summarized in this review.\",\n",

Tuberculosis (TB) killed 1.4 million people worldwide in the year 2019. Despite the advancements in tuberculosis (TB) treatments, multidrugresistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) remains a severe threat to human health. The complications are further compounded by the emergence of MDR/XDR strains and the failure of conventional drug regimens to eradicate the resistant bacterial strains. Thus, new therapeutic approaches aim to ensure cure without relapse, to prevent the occurrence of deaths and emergence of drug-resistant strains.

      "        \"content\": \"There is considerable variation in practice, both between and with different countries in the management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Whilst there is no one optimal model of service organisation there are general principles of care that can be introduced to reduce this variability. There are frequent debates and discussions about which professional group is best placed to manage ADHD at different points in the life cycle. Who delivers care is however less important than ensuring that training schemes provide adequate exposure, training and experience to both the core and non-core skills required to provide a comprehensive package of care. Most evidence-based guidelines recommend a multi-modal, multi-professional and multi-agency approach. Many also promote the use of both stepped care and shared care approaches for the management of ADHD. As most of those with ADHD continue to have ADHD-related problems into adulthood, it is important to consider how best to transition care into adulthood and think about who should deliver care to adults with ADHD. Young people with ADHD should generally be transferred to adult mental health services if they continue to have significant symptoms of ADHD or other coexisting conditions that require treatment. Unfortunately services for adults with ADHD remain relatively scarce across much of the world and some adult psychiatrists remain unsure of the diagnosis and uncertain about the appropriate use of ADHD medications in adults, but there is a strong case for increased services for adults. ADHD is on the one hand easy to treat; it is much more difficult to treat well. Although optimised care for ADHD requires routine measurement of outcomes, this often does not happen in routine clinical practice. Focusing on optimising symptoms and minimising adverse effects can significantly improve both short- and long-term outcomes.\",\n",

Conversely, failure to identify and treat adult ADHD is linked to negative outcomes. The recognition of the importance of adult ADHD in a subset of our patients challenges us to overcome our anxiety about this diagnosis and prevent the societal marginalization of vulnerable patients.

All of these developments have contributed real progress in the field, but there is still much room for improvement and unmet clinical need in ADHD pharmacotherapy. The availability of a wide range of compounds with a high degree of specificity for individual monoamines (dopamine and noradrenaline) and/or different pharmacological mechanisms has refined our understanding of the essential elements for optimum pharmacological effect in managing ADHD. In this chapter, we review the pharmacology of the different classes of drug used to treat ADHD and provide a neurochemical rationale, predominantly from the use of in vivo microdialysis experiments, to explain their relative efficacy and potential to elicit side effects. In addition, we will consider how predictions based on results from animal models translate into clinical outcomes. The treatment of ADHD is also described from the perspective of the physician.
