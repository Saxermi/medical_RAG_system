From January 1984 through December 1986, 517 verified cases of tuberculosis were reported from the county. Drug susceptibility test results to isoniazid, streptomycin, ethambutol, and rifampin were available for 256 of the 517 cases. The frequency of resistance of M. tuberculosis isolates to one or more drugs was 27% for all cases and 25% for those who had had no previous antituberculosis treatment. Isolates from Asian immigrants had the highest frequencies of resistance (33 to 45%), and the Southeast Asian immigrants had a drug-resistant tuberculosis case rate greater than 30/100,000 population per year. In patients who had cavitary lung disease and who had a previous history of tuberculosis, drug-resistant tuberculosis was 3.5 times as likely to occur than in persons who had neither of these characteristics (p less than 0.001). For such patients, the positive predictive value of isolating resistant M. tuberculosis approached 90%. We believe these community-based findings will guide clinical and public health interventions specifically appropriate for the community.\"\n",

It was shown that capreomycin had low activity with respect to the sensitive strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37 Rv in vitro and the respective infection caused by it in mice. The activity of capreomycin in vitro with respect to streptomycin resistant strains was the same as that with respect to the sensitive strains, while in vivo it increased 3 times. Capreomycin showed a tendency to decreasing its activity with respect to strains highely resistant to canamycin only in vitro. The effect of capreomycin on tuberculosis infection caused by strains resistant to different concentrations of canamycin was the same as that on tuberculosis infection caused by sensitive strains. Cross resistance between florimycin (viomycin) and capreomycin was shown. Clinical trails of capreomycin revealed its moderate therapeutic efficiency, relatively low toxicity and an allergenizing effect on the host. Transient ventibulopatia without pronounced signs of ototoxic action was observed. The nephrotoxic effect was moderate and transient. It was observed predominantly at the peak of the allergic reactions to the antitubercle drugs. The data obtained during the study allow recommendation of capreomycin use in clinics as reserve drug when the causative agent is not resistant to florimycin. The drug should be used under regular control of the blood picture, electrolyte metabolism, state of the kidneys, auditory and vestibular apparatus.\"\n",

A total of 1,869 initial cultures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis submitted to Leahi Hospital in Honolulu were screened to identify drug resistance. Of 256 patients who excreted resistant bacilli, only 55 had no history of previous antituberculous chemotherapy. The frequencies of primary drug resistance from July 1957 to July 1977 were as follows: streptomycin, 0.86 per cent; isoniazid, 1.2 per cent; para-aminosalicylic acid, 1.5 per cent. No strains were resistant to ethambutol or rifampin. A slight decrease in the incidence of drug resistance during a 20-year period was observed. This was especially significant because Hawaii's tuberculosis problem is principally confined to its foreighn-born population. Although no serious primary drug resistance problem was discovered, Hawaii possesses both the highest immigration rate and the highest incidence of tuberculosis in the United states. Therefore, there is a need for continued periodic monitoring of drug resistance in Hawaii.\"\n",
