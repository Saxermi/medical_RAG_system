Clinical results are very promising. The high efficacy of these combinations is due to the synergistic potentiation of single-drug activities.

Experimental approaches to this disease include the discovery of new drugs, including taxol and ifosfamide; evaluation of candidate drugs such as tetraplatin and topotecan; and approaches to overcome intrinsic and/or acquired resistance. The latter has been addressed by increasing dose-intensity of currently available therapy, developing agents to abrogate dose-limiting toxicity, and by attempts to interfere with mechanisms of resistance.\n",
      "PMID: 1454973, Title: The multidrug-resistant tuberculosis challenge to public health efforts to control tuberculosis., Content: After years of steady decline, there has been an unprecedented resurgence of tuberculosis (TB) in the United States and outbreaks of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The authors assess the nature, epidemiology, and implications of MDR-TB; provide suggestions for preventing drug resistance among patients with drug-susceptible TB; and offer recommendations for managing patients with MDR-TB. They outline the National Action Plan to Combat MDR-TB. Close collaboration among medical practitioners and staff members of TB control programs is needed to ensure the most effective management of patients with TB and their contacts. This collaboration is one of the most important steps for successful control of MDR-TB.\n",
      "PMID: 3299646, Title: Resistance of bacteria to antibacterial agents: report of Task Force 2., Content: The use of a growing number of antibacterial agents over the past half century has elicited a widespread deployment of genes for resistance to these agents in populations of bacteria throughout the world. Task Force 2 of the NIH Study on Antibiotic Use and Antibiotic Resistance Worldwide found that data on prevalence of resistance was fragmentary and underanalyzed but indicative of several trends. Resistance to older antibacterial agents appears to have stabilized overall, but shifts of resistance genes into new strains and species have continued to cause new clinical problems. Resistance to newer antibacterial agents has increased. Resistance is more prevalent in developing countries. Systematic surveillance of resistance integrated with understanding of its molecular basis is needed for control of resistance.\n",

No objective responses were noted in any of the patients treated. By restricting the entry criteria to heavily pre-treated patients, the identification of new active agents in phase II trials may be hindered. Alternative strategies for the investigation of new agents in patients with GCT should be considered, particularly when studying the efficacy and relative toxicity of platinum analogues.\n",
      "PMID: 3079288, Title: Mechanisms and clinical significance of multidrug resistance., Content: Tumor cells often become refractory to diverse drugs with different mechanisms of cytotoxic action. This paper reviews the current state of our knowledge of multidrug resistance, the limitations of present concepts to fully explain the diversity of the MDR phenotypes, and the clinical relevance of these studies derived largely from cell culture systems. The authors discuss the use of markers associated with the multi-drug resistance phenotype to identify potentially drug-resistant tumors and outline strategies that might be used to overcome the resistance phenomenon.\n",
      "PMID: 3150951, Title: In vitro activity of antimicrobial agents against mycobacteria., Content: The aims of this study were to investigate the possible effects of new antimicrobial agents, the conventional antituberculosis drugs and several combinations of these agents against 190 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 30 of M. avium.\n",
      "PMID: 2162298, Title: Resistance to quinolones in gram-negative microorganisms: mechanisms and prevention., Content: Bacterial resistance to quinolones is essentially the result of mutations on several genes involved in the synthesis of DNA-gyrase or in proteins of the cellular envelope. A single mutational event may lead to complete resistance to older quinolones, but clinical resistance to newer quinolones such as norfloxacin requires two or more mutations. Prevention of resistance to norfloxacin requires prevention of the strains carrying 'first mutations' (by a controlled use of older quinolones) and the early detection of such strains. If microbiologic and pharmacologic data are taken into account at the same time, the incidence of norfloxacin-resistant strains in urinary tract infections will remain insignificant.\n",
      "PMID: 1677748, Title: Primary care intervention and management for adults with early HIV infection., Content: Recent clinical drug trials have demonstrated that early intervention with zidovudine will delay disease progression in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic HIV-infected individuals. These trials will encourage larger numbers of seropositive persons to seek access to primary care, overloading specialized clinics for AIDS and HIV care. The care of early HIV-infected individuals will need to be delivered by mainstream primary care providers. This article discusses the initiation and management of zidovudine, and chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in early HIV infection.\n",

Resistance to newer antibacterial agents has increased. Resistance is more prevalent in developing countries.

Drug susceptibility test results to isoniazid, streptomycin, ethambutol, and rifampin were available for 256 of the 517 cases. The frequency of resistance of M. tuberculosis isolates to one or more drugs was 27% for all cases and 25% for those who had had no previous antituberculosis treatment. Isolates from Asian immigrants had the highest frequencies of resistance (33 to 45%), and the Southeast Asian immigrants had a drug-resistant tuberculosis case rate greater than 30/100,000 population per year. In patients who had cavitary lung disease and who had a previous history of tuberculosis, drug-resistant tuberculosis was 3.5 times as likely to occur than in persons who had neither of these characteristics (p less than 0.001). For such patients, the positive predictive value of isolating resistant M. tuberculosis approached 90%. We believe these community-based findings will guide clinical and public health interventions specifically appropriate for the community.\"\n",

The activity of capreomycin in vitro with respect to streptomycin resistant strains was the same as that with respect to the sensitive strains, while in vivo it increased 3 times. Capreomycin showed a tendency to decreasing its activity with respect to strains highely resistant to canamycin only in vitro. The effect of capreomycin on tuberculosis infection caused by strains resistant to different concentrations of canamycin was the same as that on tuberculosis infection caused by sensitive strains. Cross resistance between florimycin (viomycin) and capreomycin was shown. Clinical trails of capreomycin revealed its moderate therapeutic efficiency, relatively low toxicity and an allergenizing effect on the host. Transient ventibulopatia without pronounced signs of ototoxic action was observed. The nephrotoxic effect was moderate and transient. It was observed predominantly at the peak of the allergic reactions to the antitubercle drugs. The data obtained during the study allow recommendation of capreomycin use in clinics as reserve drug when the causative agent is not resistant to florimycin. The drug should be used under regular control of the blood picture, electrolyte metabolism, state of the kidneys, auditory and vestibular apparatus.\"\n",

A total of 1,869 initial cultures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis submitted to Leahi Hospital in Honolulu were screened to identify drug resistance. Of 256 patients who excreted resistant bacilli, only 55 had no history of previous antituberculous chemotherapy. The frequencies of primary drug resistance from July 1957 to July 1977 were as follows: streptomycin, 0.86 per cent; isoniazid, 1.2 per cent; para-aminosalicylic acid, 1.5 per cent. No strains were resistant to ethambutol or rifampin. A slight decrease in the incidence of drug resistance during a 20-year period was observed. This was especially significant because Hawaii's tuberculosis problem is principally confined to its foreighn-born population. Although no serious primary drug resistance problem was discovered, Hawaii possesses both the highest immigration rate and the highest incidence of tuberculosis in the United states. Therefore, there is a need for continued periodic monitoring of drug resistance in Hawaii.\"\n",
