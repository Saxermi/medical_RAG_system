Glutamate acts as the excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and is mediated largely by the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs). The objective of the study was to determine the distribution of VGLUT2 mRNA in the turtle brain by in\\xa0situ hybridization. Intense expression was observed in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, nucleus dorsomedialis thalami, nucleus dorsolateralis thalami, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, nucleus reuniens and nucleus periventricularis hypothalami. Moderate expression was noticed in the nucleus rotundus, area lateralis hypothalami, reticular nucleus, cerebellar nucleus and nucleus cochlearis. In conclusion, this study reveals many glutamatergic neurons in the turtle brain.', 'PMID': 27402225}\n",

The electrical or chemical stimulation of the parafascicularis nucleus induced a decrease in striatal [3H]serotonin release and an increase in [3H]serotonin release in the dorsalis raphe nucleus. The blockade of cholinergic (mecamylamine) and glutamatergic (PK 26124) transmissions at the striatal level did not modify the thalamic stimulation-induced effect on serotonin release in the caudate nucleus or in the dorsalis raphe nucleus. However, a decrease induced by parafascicularis nucleus stimulation in serotonin release in the caudate nucleus could not be observed when the autoreceptors present on serotoninergic nerve cell bodies localized in the dorsalis raphe nucleus were blocked by a methiothepin perfusion within the nucleus.

Although there are reports of a few of the projections of these nuclei, they had not previously been the subject of a detailed study. We found that different cell types in the lentiformis mesencephali, pars medialis and the lentiformis mesencephali, pars lateralis have descending projections to different targets. These targets include the inferior olive, the cerebellum, the lateral pontine nucleus, the nucleus papillioformis, the nucleus of the basal optic root, the nucleus mesencephalicus profundus, pars ventralis, the nucleus principalis precommissuralis, and the stratum cellulare externum. We found that a few cells in the lentiformis mesencephali project to the medial pontine nucleus, but that a much heavier projection arises from the nucleus laminaris precommissuralis, which is medial to the nucleus lentiformis mesencephali, pars medialis. The tectal gray has predominantly ascending projections to the diencephalon. The nuclei that it projects to are the nucleus intercalatus thalami, the nucleus of the ventral supraoptic decussation, the nucleus posteroventralis, the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, the nucleus dorsolateralis medialis, and the nucleus dorsolateralis anterior. The tectal gray also projects topographically to layers 4 and 8-13 of the optic tectum. Area pretectalis has both ascending and descending projections. It has ipsilateral ascending projections to the nucleus dorsolateralis anterior, pars magnocellularis, the nucleus lateralis anterior, and the nucleus ventrolateralis thalami. It has ipsilateral descending projections to the central gray, the nucleus of the basal optic root, pars dorsalis, the lateral pontine nucleus, and the deep layers of the optic tectum.

We have used anterograde autoradiographic and retrograde HRP techniques to investigate the efferent connections of the retinorecipient pretectal nuclei in the pigeon. In the accompanying paper we identified these nuclei in the pigeon as the nucleus lentiformis mesencephali--pars lateralis and pars medialis, the tectal gray, the area pretectalis, and pretectalis diffusus. Although there are reports of a few of the projections of these nuclei, they had not previously been the subject of a detailed study. We found that different cell types in the lentiformis mesencephali, pars medialis and the lentiformis mesencephali, pars lateralis have descending projections to different targets. These targets include the inferior olive, the cerebellum, the lateral pontine nucleus, the nucleus papillioformis, the nucleus of the basal optic root, the nucleus mesencephalicus profundus, pars ventralis, the nucleus principalis precommissuralis, and the stratum cellulare externum. We found that a few cells in the lentiformis mesencephali project to the medial pontine nucleus, but that a much heavier projection arises from the nucleus laminaris precommissuralis, which is medial to the nucleus lentiformis mesencephali, pars medialis. The tectal gray has predominantly ascending projections to the diencephalon. The nuclei that it projects to are the nucleus intercalatus thalami, the nucleus of the ventral supraoptic decussation, the nucleus posteroventralis, the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, the nucleus dorsolateralis medialis, and the nucleus dorsolateralis anterior. The tectal gray also projects topographically to layers 4 and 8-13 of the optic tectum. Area pretectalis has both ascending and descending projections. It has ipsilateral ascending projections to the nucleus dorsolateralis anterior, pars magnocellularis, the nucleus lateralis anterior, and the nucleus ventrolateralis thalami.

The results indicate that the nucleus gives rise to two major ascending pathways and a smaller descending pathway. One large ascending pathway terminates densely in most regions of the periventricular zone of the hypothalamus, with the notable exception of the suprachiasmatic, suprachiasmatic preoptic, and median preoptic nuclei. This pathway is in a position to influence directly many cell groups known to regulate anterior pituitary function. The second large pathway ascends through the medial zone of the hypothalamus and densely innervates the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial nucleus and adjacent basal parts of the lateral hypothalamic area, medial preoptic nucleus, principal nucleus of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis, ventral lateral septal nucleus, posterodorsal part of the medial nucleus of the amygdala, posterior nucleus, and immediately adjacent regions of the posterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala. It is already known that these regions are major components of the sexually dimorphic circuit, and, interestingly, that they provide the major neural inputs to the PMv. The smaller descending projection from the PMv seems to innervate preferentially the posterior hypothalamic nucleus, although a small number of fibers appear to end in the tuberomammillary nucleus, supramammillary nucleus, specific regions of the medial mammillary nucleus, interfascicular nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, periaqueductal gray, dorsal nucleus of the raphe, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, Barrington's nucleus, and locus coeruleus. Relatively sparse terminal fields associated with ascending fibers were also observed in the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus; in the nucleus reuniens, parataenial nucleus, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, and mediodorsal nucleus; in the central nucleus of the amygdala, anterodorsal part of the medial nucleus of the amygdala, posterior part of the basomedial nucleus of the amygdala; and in the ventral subiculum and adjacent parts of hippocampal field CA1, and the infralimbic and prelimbic areas of the medial prefrontal cortex. Taken as a whole, the evidence suggests that the PMv receives two major inputs--one from the sexually dimorphic circuit, and the other from the blood in the form of gonadal steroid hormones--and gives rise to two major outputs: one (perhaps feed-forward) to the neuroendocrine (periventricular) zone of the hypothalamus, and the other (perhaps feed-back) to the sexually dimorphic circuit.\", 'contents': \"Projections of the ventral premammillary nucleus.
